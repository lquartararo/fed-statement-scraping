# FOMC Meeting Statements & Minutes
This repository automatically scrapes and aggregates the Federal Reserve FOMC meeting statements and minutes - creating a dataset that enables tracking US monetary policy changes through time.

It works by polling the website of the U.S. Federal Reserve on a periodic basis and scraping the new statements and minutes as they become available. 
The scraper runs in a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow, which is [available here](https://github.com/vtasca/fed-statement-scraping/actions/workflows/main.yml).

The dataset begins in the year 2000 and the textual data is presented as it is found on the website of the Federal Reserve.

## Usage
The updated dataset is located in this repository at [`communications.csv`](https://github.com/vtasca/fed-statement-scraping/blob/master/communications.csv). If found, new data is added on a weekly basis on Monday mornings.

### Data description
- `Date` - Date of the FOMC meeting.
- `Release Date` - Release date of the statement/minutes. Note that minutes are usually released with a ~3 week lag from the meeting date.
- `Type` - Communication type, either a statement or minutes.
- `Text` - The text content of each communication release.

### Availability
This dataset is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vladtasca/fomc-meeting-statements-and-minutes), together with related Jupyter notebooks.

## Background information
The [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) meets eight times during the year to make decisions regarding the implementation of monetary policy, with the aim of achieving the Federal Reserve's dual mandate: promoting maximum employment and maintaining stable prices (controlling inflation).

The FOMC meeting statement document is one of the main formal communication documents used by the Fed, and contains information about key interest rate decisions, an assessment of the economic outlook, a view on inflation as well as forward guidance. This information helps businesses, investors and the general public take monetary policy into account and make more informed economic decisions.
